Collect code for automatic sample preparation.

This repository contains collected pipetting scripts for the Tecan Evo Freedom liquid handling robot. The scripts are part of the work  of optimizing an automated immunofluorescence sample preparation protocol for suspension cells. The repository also conatains the pipe line used in Cell profiliner to segment cell nuclei using the DAPI stain and therby count the number of cells in each image. These scripts (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3463285) connects to the article published with DOI:x (to be added when manuscript is published).
